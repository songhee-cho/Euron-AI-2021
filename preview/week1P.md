* **CS231n overview**

### **2. Several Note-takings about the Lecture(내용 정리) 🧙**

* **A brief history of computer vision**
  -  **Block world(Larry Roberts, 1963)**: early 1960' was the start of computer vision.
  -  **The summer vision project of MIT(Saymour Papert, 1966)**: it's an attempt to construct a significant part of a visual system(pattern recognition).
  -  **VISON(David Marr, 1970')**: input image → primal sketch →  2.5D sketch →  3D model
  -  **Similar ideas in 1970'**: (every obj → simple geometric primitives), (complex structure → collection of simpler shapes & geometric configuration)
      -  Generalized cylinder(Brooks & Binford, 1979)
      -  Pictorial structure(Fischelr and Elschlager, 1973)
  - **Face detection(Viola & Johnes, 2001)**: real-time face detector
  - **Histogram of gradients(Dala & Triggs, 2005)**
  - **ImageNet**: large scale visual recognition challenge to make more accurate graphical machine, SVM, AdaBoost models(This concept about ImageNet is not clear. I should check whether it is true.).
    - Error rate of models using ImageNet is continuously decreasing. Especially, 2012 was the breakthrough moment.

* **CS231n overview**
  - CS231n focuses on one of the most important problems of visual recognition - image classification.
  - There is a number of visual recognition problems that are related to image classification, such as obj detection, img captioning.
  - CNN(Convoutional Neural Networks) have become an important tool for obj recognition.
    - large scale visual recognition challenge: deeper networks / NEC-UIUC → SuperVision → GoogLeNet, VGG → MSRA
  - CNNs were not invented overnight.
    - 1998: transistors
    - 2012: transistors, GPUs 
  - The quest for visual intelligence goes far beyond obj recognition.
    - computer vision models that see(understand) a scene like human visual system.
    - it's far to develop network models to understand complex images.
